In this project, I led the development of an intelligent chatbot solution tailored for customer support and product recommendations in the chemistry industry. The chatbot leveraged state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process vast amounts of product information sourced from the company's website and internal documents. Within just three months, I successfully delivered a fully functional, end-to-end solution that seamlessly integrated with the company’s workflows.

By employing advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, text summarization, and a two-layer search system, I significantly improved the chatbot's ability to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses. The innovative search mechanism combined product name filtering with relation matching, enabling the chatbot to handle complex multi-hop questions effectively. To ensure transparency and user trust, I incorporated Responsible AI mechanisms, providing clear justifications for product recommendations and aligning the solution with the company’s ethical standards.

This modular chatbot system not only addressed the company's immediate needs but also offered flexibility for future customizations and scalability. By combining technical expertise in NLP, machine learning, and Explainable AI with a deep understanding of user needs, I created a robust and impactful tool that enhanced customer support capabilities and streamlined operations.
