      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I led the development of an intelligent chatbot solution tailored for customer support and product recommendations in the chemistry industry. The chatbot leveraged state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process vast amounts of product information sourced from the company&amp;rsquo;s website and internal documents. Within just three months, I successfully delivered a fully functional, end-to-end solution that seamlessly integrated with the company’s workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By employing advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, text summarization, and a two-layer search system, I significantly improved the chatbot&amp;rsquo;s ability to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses. The innovative search mechanism combined product name filtering with relation matching, enabling the chatbot to handle complex multi-hop questions effectively. To ensure transparency and user trust, I incorporated Responsible AI mechanisms, providing clear justifications for product recommendations and aligning the solution with the company’s ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
